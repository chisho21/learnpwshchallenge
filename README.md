# What the what?
This is a humble attempt to introduce you to powershell and all it's glory. This will be a challenge based approach, some answers will come easy, others you may have to dig for. But it'll be fun? and involve googling things.

## Prerequisites
### Powerhsell (duh?)
You can certainly complete everything in this repo using Windows PowerShell 5.1, but that's boring. Get on the new stuff and install PowerShell 7.2 (for linux and mac too!)

- Via Chocolatey 
```
choco install powershell-core
```
- Via MSI - [PowerShell Releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)

### VSCode (for developy reasons)
- Via Chocolatey 
```
choco install vscode
```
- Via MSI - [vscode releases](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

# Big List of PowerShell Training Resources

## Videos

#### - [PowerShell for Beginners 3.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMn8-BbRsN8&list=PLyJiOytEPs4etH7Ujq7PU7jlOlHL-9RmV)
This is the series that got me started so I am biased. I steal most of what I know and say from this series. Well worth the investment.
#### - [PowerShell Master Class by John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQm4zRvvX58&list=PLlVtbbG169nFq_hR7FcMYg32xsSAObuq8)
This guy can hold my attention, even as a disembodied voice. Also, check out his series on Azure and Devops.

#### - [Digital Transformation: Thriving Through the Transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHxkcndCQoI)
This is just a presentation by Jeffrey Snover (inventor of powershell) about figuring out where tech is heading and what it means for your career.
## Courses
#### - [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/powershell/)
Microsoft has actually done an amazing job with their learning resources and is able to keep these up to date.
## Games
#### - [Under The Wire](https://underthewire.tech/wargames)
This is the same Capture the Flag format as Over The Wire for linux.

#### - [PS Koans](https://github.com/vexx32/PSKoans)
The goal of the PowerShell koans is to teach you PowerShell by presenting you with a set of questions. Each k≈çan (each question) is represented by a failing Pester test.

## Books
#### - [PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition?a_aid=jdhit&a_bid=2326a8ab)
Will probably take more than a month, but this is where I steal most of my content.

#### - [PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking](https://bit.ly/PSToolmaking)
By the same guy (Don Jones) as above. Great deep dive into making stuff for others to use.

#### - [Become Hardcore Extreme Black Belt PowerShell Ninja Rockstar](https://leanpub.com/become-powershell)
Set of challenge questions to see if you actually know what you think you know about PowerShell.
#### - [Shell of an Idea: The Untold History of PowerShell](https://leanpub.com/shell-of-an-idea)
You'd have to be a real nerd to read this one... so i have and loved it.
